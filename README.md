Database Design Explanation
I've created a comprehensive e-commerce database design that supports all the requirements mentioned in your assignment. Let me walk you through the key components:
Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The ERD shows how all tables relate to each other in this e-commerce system. Let me explain the main entities and their relationships:

Core Product Structure:

product table contains basic product information
product_item represents specific purchasable variations of a product
product_variation links items to their specific color and size attributes


Categorization System:

product_category with a self-referential relationship for hierarchical categories
brand for manufacturer information


Variation Attributes:

color for available colors
size_category and size_option for organizing size information


Product Attributes:

attribute_category groups attributes (e.g., physical, technical)
attribute_type defines data types for attributes
product_attribute stores custom attributes that can be associated with either products or specific items


Visual Components:

product_image stores image references, which can be linked to either general products or specific items



Key Design Considerations

Flexibility: This design allows for products with or without variations, and accommodates different attribute requirements across product categories.
Performance: I've added appropriate indexes on foreign keys to optimize query performance.
Data Integrity: Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity, and check constraints verify data validity (e.g., ensuring a product attribute is associated with either a product or a product item).
Normalization: The database follows good normalization practices to minimize data redundancy.
Sample Data: I've included sample data to demonstrate how the database would work with real information.

Data Flow

Products are categorized and associated with brands
Each product can have multiple items (purchasable variations)
These variations are linked to specific attributes like color and size
Custom attributes provide additional product information
Images can be linked to either general products or specific variations

Recommendations for Implementation
For your group project, I recommend:

Version Control: Create a GitHub repository and ensure everyone uses branches for their contributions.
Testing: Create a test dataset to validate that all relationships work as expected.
Documentation: Document the database schema, any constraints, and provide examples of common queries for typical e-commerce operations.
Consider Future Extensions: Think about how you might extend this database to include customer data, orders, payments, and shipping information.

This design provides a solid foundation for an e-commerce system that can handle complex product structures while maintaining data integrity and performance. The SQL script is ready to be executed to create the database, complete with sample data to help with testing.
